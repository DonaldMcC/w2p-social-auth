# w2p-social-auth
The master branch of this is now just a scaled back version of the original w2p-social-auth without version 0.1.24 included in the plugin.  This works with version 0.2.19 and 0.2.21 (latest) of python social auth at least for 4 providers tested so far and can be tested at the following link:  https://www.netdecisionmaking.com/w2ppsatest

This has now been updated and works with v1.4.0 of social_auth_core and also works with v1.7.0 which is latest released version.  The sample app has logins for Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook and Google.  However Twitter has stopped working and now gives an error since they changed the requirements and it now needs a valid redirect.
